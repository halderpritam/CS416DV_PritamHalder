            Fuel-efficient cars cause less pollution over the same amount of distance traveled. They also cost less to
            operate. Buying a fuel-efficient car can save you thousands of dollars as well as they are environment
            friendly.
            There are many factors that can affect the mileage of a car (See:

            In this interactive visualization, we will explore 2023 data about the the respective highway and city
            MPGs of automobiles, with respect to factors like engine cylinders, transmission type, drive and the
            make of the vehicle. We will also draw a relation between engine displacement and Co2 emission. These graphs
            will likely to be a guidance on choosing a fuel efficient and environment friendly car.

    <h2 id="two">Does Engine Displacement Affect Mileage?</h2>
    <p>This scatterplot will show you how engine replacement across different car brands affects their mileage.
        Additionally, hovering
        over each data point itself will indicate which make of the car you are hovering along with tranmission of the
        car via an interactive tooltip.
        This chart can be filtered by hovering over legend items (Cylinder number of car). Once filtered simply click on
        any legend item to get back unfiltered data. You can click here to <a href="#" id="reloadLink2">Reload</a> the graph.

    <h2 id="three">Is there a relationship between CO2 emission and engine displacement?</h2>
    <p>This scatterplot will show us a relation between engine displacement and combined CO2 emission. You will notice
        that Co2 emission of a larger engine is
        more than a smaller engine. If someone is looking to buy a car and more focused on obtaining an environment
        friendly car, this graph will certainly provide a good idea.
        An interactive tooltip has been added to porvide more details like car brand, combined mileage and air pollution
        score.
        This chart can be filtered by hovering over legend items (Air pollution score, 8 APS means cleanest vehicle in
        terms of emission). Once filtered simply click on any legend item to get back unfiltered data.

    <h2>About this Visualization</h2>
    <p>
        This is a narrative visualization created for the CS 498 Data Visualization course.
    </p>
    <h3>Messaging</h3>
    <p>
        Fuel-efficient cars emit less pollution over the same amount of distance traveled. They also cost less to operate. 
        Buying a more fuel-efficient car can save you thousands of dollars on fuel costs over time and can often balance out a higher purchase 
        price if you keep the car long enough. There are many factors that can affect the mileage of your car, but in this interactive visualization, 
        we will explore 2023 data about the the respective highway and city MPGs of automobiles, with respect to just a few of these factors, 
        like engine cylinders, fuel type and the make of the vehicle. If you are looking for a cost effective car, you should pick a 
        car which is having cylinder count and engine displacement on the lower side. Another message is, good milege cars are definately better for environment.
    </p>
    <h3>Narrative Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The above visualization utilizes the slideshow narrative visualization technique, while incorporating hybrid
        elements of the drill-down technique. Each slide contains guidance on how to interact with the visualization.
    </p>
    <h3>Visual Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The structure of the slides guides users
        from one idea to the next, but there is still room for individual exploration at each stage. We accomplish
        visual consistency by maintaining uniform elements throughout, introducing a mixture of text, image and chart
        elements, and having meaningful colors (highest APS is shown by green color and lowest one is shown as maroon).
        Every
        chart has some cool data population animation which will demand users attention.
    </p>
    <h3>Scenes</h3>
    <p>
        The scenes themselves are constructed via HTML id tags. Each scene has a unique id that is linked via the
        buttons.The “Next/Previous”
        buttons allow users to navigate from scene to scene independently, but the structure helps guide the overall
        narrative.
        Each scene is composed of a unique chart that highlights its own distinct message.
    </p>
    <h3>Annotations</h3>
    <p>
        Annotations remain consistent on the charts, even throughout changes triggered by the interactions. This allows
        the user
        to have some grounding on the overall message the visualization is trying to communicate. For example, the
        annotation
        about a relatively good gas mileage stays consistent throughout the vis transformation from multiple car brands
        to single car brand data representation.
        This can help a user to better understand which car gives better mileage.
    </p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        The visualizations have a handful of relevant parameters that help the user better explore the data. By
        interacting with
        JavaScript input features, such as the dropdown filter in vis1 or the interactive legend in vis2, the user can
        choose to
        see
        data about a specific category, or even filter out the datapoints by hovering over specific engine cylinder
        categories.
        The user input is used as a parameter that controls what the visualization portrays.
    </p>
    <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p>
        The triggers are implemented via events and callbacks, such as “mouseover”, “mouseout” and “click”. When
        specific html elements
        experience these events, the callback function is invoked, and we can change the visualization with respect to
        the
        action indicated by the trigger. The example triggers we have here are the dropdowns and hovering legend.
